rfc-draw is a python application.
If you don't already have python installed on your computer,
   you could take a look at https://realpython.com/installing-python/

To use rfc-draw you'll need to install the following python modules:  
   os, math, pathlib, re, sys, time, datetime, tkinter,  
   playsound, threading,  
   traceback (for POSIX and windows),  
   termios (for POSIX) or msvcrt (for Windows)  

To install a python module, e.g. tkinter, use pip, python's package
manager; the (POSIX) command is  
   pip3 install tkinter 
  
If that doesn't work, you may need to use a more up-to-date version of pip,  
i.e. one that matches your version of python, for example pip3.10


Two .wav files (of bell sounds) are included in the rfc-draw distribution;
these are from BigSoundBank, https://bigsoundbank.com/
