All of RFC-Draw's python code is on github,
  URL https://github.com/nevil-brownlee/rfc-draw

When you look at that URL, you'll see a button (maybe coloured green)
labelled '<> Code'.  Now ...

1. Click the '<>Code'  button on RFC-Draw'sgithub page.
2. That brings up a menu, it's bottom item is 'Download ZIP'.
   Click 'Download ZIP' to get rfcdraw-main.zip in your ~/Downloads folder.
3. Move ~/Downloads/rfc-draw-main.zip into your top-level directory.
4. In rfc-draw-main, tar -cvf RFC-Draw.tar . (or unzip)
     to unzip RFC-Draw's files into rfc-draw-main
5. AT this stage, rfc-draw-main is the directory containing all
   of RFC-Draw's files.  Rename it to whatever seems sensible to you,
     e.g. RFC-Draw
6. Now, in your renamed rfc-draw-main directory, you can run RFC-Draw,
     python3 RFC-Draw.py should start it for you.

RFC-Draw's README.md file has all the instructions you'll need to use it.
