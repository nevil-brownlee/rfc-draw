<p>RFC-draw is a python tkinter-based drawing system, with three components:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>rfc-draw.py</em> - interactive drawing program to create on-screen diagrams,<br />
  and save them to rfc-draw-data (.rdd) files</p></li>
<li><p><em>rdd-to-svg.py</em> - creates a drawing’s SVG file that conforms to the RFC7996 SVG schema</p></li>
<li><p><em>rdd-to-ascii.py</em> - creates a drawing’s ASCII-art (.txt) file</p></li>
</ul>
<p>rfc-draw.py let’s you draw (with your mouse) three kinds of objects, in three layers, with restrictions to allow for ASCII-art:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Lines<br />
  Lines have one or more segments; each segment must be either horizontal or vertical.</p></li>
<li><p>Rectangles<br />
  Rectangles may have line(s) of text at their centre.</p></li>
<li><p>Text<br />
  A text object has one or more (centred) lines of text.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>To use rfc-draw you’ll need to install the following python modules:<br />
  tkinter, math, sys, re, os, svgwrite, traceback (for POSIX and windows)<br />
  termios (for POSIX) or msvcrt (for Windows)</p>
<p>To install a python module, e.g. tkinter, the (POSIX) command is<br />
   pip3 install tkinter</p>
<p>If that doesn’t work, you may need to use a more up-to-date version of pip,<br />
i.e. one that matches your version of python, for example pip3.10</p>
