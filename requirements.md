rfc-draw is a python3 application.  
If you don't already have python installed on your computer,  
&emsp;you could take a look at https://realpython.com/installing-python/  

To use rfc-draw you'll need to install the following python modules:  
&emsp;os, math, pathlib, re, sys, time, datetime, threading,  
&emsp;playsound, tkinter, traceback (for POSIX and windows),  
&emsp;termios (for POSIX) or msvcrt (for Windows)    

RFC-Draw tests for these on startup, and will install them for you.

&emsp;use pip3, python's package manager; the (POSIX) command is  
&emsp;pip3 install tkinter  

If that doesn't work, you may need to use a more up-to-date version of pip,  
i.e. one that matches your version of python, for example pip3.10
